What would happen if those with chronic diseases had a destination where
all of their needs (mind, body and spirit) could be addressed under
one roof? Via proprietary research, we have identified 6 personas that
represent the chronically ill. Working with our health care clients,
we are developing behavioral interventions to address the needs of this population.
