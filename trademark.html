      <p>What’s In a Name</o>

      <p>Names. They hold a power all their own. That’s why we put as much effort
      into naming our agency as most parents do for their first born.</p>

      <p>That’s also why we’re serious about protecting it.</p>

      <p>innovation Management, in use since 1993, and the accompanying wordmark wordmark
      were registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on
      October 31, 2006, register number 3,166,262. It’s the representation—and the reputation—of
      our company in the public arena.</p>

      <p>
      You may cite our company name as shown here:
      </p>
      <p>
      innovation Management®
      </p>
      <p>
      On second reference, it is acceptable to write: iM
      </p>

      <p>
      You may not, however, use our logos and design trademarks (as opposed to our trademarks that consist solely of words) without our prior written authorization.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, you may not use our trademarks:
      </p>
      <li>In, as, or as part of your own trademarks</li>
      <li>To identify products or services that are not ours</li>
      <li>In a manner likely to cause confusion</li>
      <li>In a manner that implies inaccurately that we sponsor or endorse,
        or are otherwise connected with, your own activities, products, and services</li>

      <br />
      <p>Because, after all, it’s our good name.</p>
